# Library App

## Features

- Users will see the “Recently Release Books”, “Top Books” and “Editor’s Pick” sections when they enter the website.
- The + and - are working like a dial. You can use that to see as many entries as you want in the "top books" section between 1-10. The dial part is shifted below and makes room for the entries. Also, set a limit that Nobody can dial below 1 and above 10. 
- For the Editor’s Pick option, clicking on an Image will create a section below that will show the details (title, price) of the given book.
- To fetch data, I tried using google or open library API. But there were some unwanted problems in getting the API so I used itbook API which is working. Will switch to another API soon.
